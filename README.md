# Endless
*Play endlessly, or at least until you fail.*

Adds an Endless mode to Beat Saber, accessible via a gameplay setup tab. You can configure what features the maps being played should have, such as:
* Difficulty
* Requirements (Noodle Extensions, Chroma)
* Playlist (can be set to "All" if you want to use all maps)

**IMPORTANT:** This mod has issues with Replay; you will most likely encounter crashes with Replay enabled.

Use `qpm s build` to build

Same goes for `qpm s copy` and `qpm s qmod`
